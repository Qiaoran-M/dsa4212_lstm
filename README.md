# dsa4212_lstm

## Introduction

This repository contains a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model implemented from scratch using mainly `numpy` and `jax` Python libraries. 

The purpose of this model is to perform prediction on time series data. Specifically, we trained and evaluated the model on ...[dataset]...
